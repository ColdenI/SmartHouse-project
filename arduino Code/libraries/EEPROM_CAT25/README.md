## Addressing

The CAT25040/CAT25020/CAT25010 use 8 address bits, while the larger EEPROMs use
16 bits (or 24 bits for the 1MBit chips and above). The CAT25040 however, needs
9 bits, so bit position 3 of the READ or WRITE instrutions is used as the 9th
bit of the address. This is handled automatically by the library. There are no
address alignment considerations for either byte or block read/write methods.


## Startup

Call the constructor with the SPI bus, chip select, and device. Devices are defined
in EEPROM_CAT25.h and have names like CAT25512. More than one device can be instantiated.

```
EEPROM_CAT25 EEPROM(&SPI, 22, CAT25512);
EEPROM_CAT25 EEPROM1(&SPI, 23, CAT25M01);
```

Call begin(). Without parameters, begin() uses the default speed for this
library (4MHz). Note that SPI transaction support is required.

```
EEPROM.begin();
EEPROM1.begin(8000000UL);      // or specify SPI clock speed in Hz
```

Call end() to set the chip select pin back to INPUT.

```
EEPROM.end();
```


## Ready Flag

All reading and writing methods will first check that the EEPROM is ready (not busy with
a previous write) by calling the isReady() method, which returns a bool. If busy, yield()
will be called repeatedly until the EEPROM is ready, which may take up to 5ms if called
immediately after a full page write. This method can be called directly:

```
while (!isReady()) {
  yield();
}
```

Additionally, getStatusRegister() can be called to get the status register contents directly.
See EEPROM_CAT25.h for register definitions.

```
uint8_t ret = getStatusRegister();
```


## Write Enable

Before writing, the write latch must be enabled. This is handled automatically by the write
methods, however, it can also be called directly:

```
enableWrite();
```

Additionally, disableWrite() can be called:

```
disableWrite();
```


## Byte Transfers

Call readByte with the address to read one byte. Returns 0 if address >= capacity.
Because valid data could also be 0, use readBlock() to catch this error.

```
uint32_t address = 0x000A;
uint8_t byte = EEPROM.readByte(address);
```

Call writeByte with the address and the byte to write. Returns 0 if address >= capacity,
otherwise, returns 1.

```
uint32_t address = 0x000A;
uint8_t byte = 0x1F;
size_t ret = EEPROM.writeByte(address, byte);
```


## Block Transfers

Call readBlock() with the address, length to read, and a pointer to the buffer used to
store the data read. Any length can be used, limited by the size of the buffer. If the length
exceeds the last address, it will NOT wrap to address 0. Note that this method knows nothing about
the size of the buffer used, so ensure length is not set too high or a buffer overflow will
occur. Returns 0 if (length + address) > capacity or length = 0.

```
#define START_ADDRESS   0x001A
#define BUFFER_SIZE     64
uint8_t buffer[BUFFER_SIZE];
size_t ret = EEPROM.readBlock(START_ADDRESS, BUFFER_SIZE, buffer);        // entire buffer
size_t ret1 = EEPROM1.readBlock(START_ADDRESS, 4, &buffer[16]);           // partial buffer
```

Call writeBlock() with the address, length to write, and a pointer to the source buffer used
for the data to be written. Any length can be used, limited by the size of the buffer. If the
length exceeds the last address, it will NOT wrap to address 0. Any address can be used within
a page. Bytes within a page that are not written will be left unchanged. Note that this method
knows nothing about the size of the buffer used, so ensure length is not set too high or data
will be read past the end of the buffer. Returns 0 if (length + address) > capacity or
length = 0. This method calls writePage() as many times as needed to transfer the entire block,
but there are no address alignment considerations as writeBlock() handles this automatically.

```
size_t ret = EEPROM.writeBlock(START_ADDRESS, BUFFER_SIZE, buffer);
```


## Page Write

While writeBlock() is normally used for block transfers, which in turn calls writePage() as
many times as needed to transfer the entire block, writePage() can be called directly.
Call writePage() with the address, length to write, and a pointer to the source buffer used
for the data to be written. Any length can be used up to the size of the buffer or the size
of the page (see EEPROM_CAT25.h for page sizes). If the length exceeds the last address of
the page, it will NOT wrap to the beginning of the page. Any address can be used within a
page. Bytes within a page that are not written will be left unchanged. Note that this method
knows nothing about the size of the buffer used, so ensure length is not set too high or data
will be read past the end of the buffer. Returns 0 if (length + address) > capacity,
length = 0, or if writing past the last page address (on page size boundaries).

```
size_t ret = EEPROM.writePage(0x001A, 10, buffer);
```


## ECC

Higher capacity devices uses ECC (Error Correction Code) logic with 6 ECC bits to correct
one bit error in 4 data bytes. Therefore, when a single byte has to be written, 4 bytes
(including the ECC bits) are reâˆ’programmed. It is recommended to write in multiples of 4
bytes in order to maximize the number of write cycles (if needed).


## Possible Future Additions/Changes

* Optimizations
* Block Protection / WP pin support
* Identification Page support
* HOLD support?
